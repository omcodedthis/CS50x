sort1 uses: Bubble Sort.

How do you know?: sort1 was one of the fastest in sorting an already sorted set of values.
In comparison to the other sorting algorithms, it has a Big Omega of n, the second smallest
order. Thus, by this and the process of elimination, sort1 is a Bubble Sort.

sort2 uses: Merge Sort.

How do you know?: sort2 was the fastest substantially in sorting a random set of values.
In comparison to the other 2 sorting algorithms, the Big O of Bubble Sort is the smallest
order,the order of nlog(n). Thus, the conclusion can be drawn that the fastest algorithm
is the Merge Sort.

sort3 uses: Selection Sort.

How do you know?: sort3 was one of the slowest in sorting an already sorted set of values &
a random set of values. In comparison to the other 2 sorting algorithms, the Big Theta
of Selection Sort is the highest order,the order of n^2. Thus, the conclusion can be
drawn that the slowest algorithm is the Selection Sort.
