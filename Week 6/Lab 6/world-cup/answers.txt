Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

The prediction that the percentage increase in time would correlate to the percentage
increase in the number of simulations ran. This was incorrect and only was true from
10000 simualtions and higher.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

The predictions had stabilised after about 1000000 simulations, with larger numbers taking
a significant amount of time, thus, it would be at around 10000000 simulations. Ultimately,
these are predictions based on a previous data set which may not be an accurate representation
of the team's current ability, and thus, may not have any true value in actually predicting
the winner of the tournament.
