# CS50: Introduction to Computer Science
This is CS50x through edX, Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. Taught by David J. Malan, CS50x teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript plus CSS and HTML. The Problem Sets are inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming. It also teaches students how to develop and present a final programming project. The repository will be updated constantly as I continue to complete this course.
