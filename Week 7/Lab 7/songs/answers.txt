If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?:
I would characterize their audio aura as Purple. From the SQL queries below, the average energy and danceability
is relatively high, with an average level of valence. This matches the traits of the Purple aura denoted by
"amped up,entertained, and moving" in the description.

SQL Queries Used:
SELECT AVG(energy) from songs; AVG(energy) = 0.659
SELECT AVG(valence) from songs; AVG(valence) = 0.484
SELECT AVG(danceability) from songs; AVG(danceability) = 0.716


Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What
better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?:
The top 100 songs are a list of the most listened songs by a user. This could be improved by taking a subset of
this list, for example, the top 30 songs instead to calculate the averages of energy, valence & danceability as
the top 30 songs may give a better representation of what songs the user actually listens to daily. Other values
such as the average tempo & loudness could be taken into consideration as well.
